### Chapter 5: Energy in Chemistry

- Two types of energy:
	1. Potential Energy: Stored Energy
	2. Kinetic Energy: Energy of Motion
- When we have a chemical reaction, we are making + breaking bonds
	- Potential energy is stored in the form of chemical bonds
	- Hard to measure the potential energy of a system (bonds) - Internal Energy

- System: this is what we are studying (usually a chemical reaction)
- Surroundings: everything outside the system
- The First Law of Thermodynamics
	- The energy of the universe is a constant.
- State Function: Only depends on where we end up and where we start, and not the path we have taken.
- Path Function: Change that depends on the route you take and not the start and end points
- △E = State Function: It requires to only know about reactants + products in a chemical reaction not what happens in between
- △E = q + w
	- q = heat of transfer of energy
	- w = work done by the system or on the system
	- If work is done on the system W > 0
	- If work is done by the system, w < 0
	- If heat is absorbed by the system, q > 0
	- If heat is released by the system, q < 0
- Work: a pushing movement (or a force) done by the system or on the system  
- At constant pressure △E = q + w
	- w = 0 so △E = q
	- △E = △H (enthalpy of reaction)
		- △H = H<sub>final</sub> - H<sub>initial</sub>
	- △H = H<sub>products</sub> - H<sub>reactants</sub>
	- If △H < 0 then the products have "less" heat than the reactants
	- If △H > 0 then the products have "more" heat than the reactants
	- If △H < 0, exothermic reaction (energy exiting the system)
	- If △H > 0, endothermic reaction (energy entering the system)

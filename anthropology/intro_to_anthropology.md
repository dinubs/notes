#### Research

* describing, explaining, and analyzing human cultural similarities
* culturual development of our species
* analyzing the biological evolution

#### Holistic

* the evolutionary ancestors of modern humans, in the broadest context possible

#### Fieldwork
* collecting primary data in natural field

#### Compariative Methhod
* The goal is to compare as much data as possible
* we do not rely on data from just one study

#### Cultural Relativism
* any aspect of a culture must be viewed and evaluated within the context of that culture
* **Ethnocentrism,** the opposite of cultural relativism, makes value judgments when describing aspects of another 
* think about your own bias

Not all anthropologists agree about the degree to which we should apply cultural relativism or whether there is or should be a universal set of values for evaluating human rights.

#### Scientific Method

Extremely difficult to use scientific method when studying humans and culture

* No two people raised alike
* variables can't be controlled
* ethical limitations
* context

#### Postmodernism
* humanistic view
* downplay comparative method
* culture is abstract
* can't remove own cultural bias

#### Awareness
* Postmodern movement has influenced anthropologists to be sensitive to issues such as power
* It has also contributed to advocacy for a more vigorous representation of the native viewpoint

Determining Values From a Chemical Symbol

| Symbol     | Co<sup>3</sup>   | Se<sup>-2</sup>   | Os<sup>+2</sup>   | 
| ---------- | :----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Protons    | 27     | 34      | 76      |
| Neutrons   | 32     | 46      | 116     |
| Electrons  | 24     | 36      | 74      |
| Net Charge | +3     | -2      | +2      |

#### Periodic Table
1. Period
     * A row that goes across from left to right, i.e. H --> He
     * Periods increase by atomic number across the table.
2. Groups
     * A column that goes down the periodic table, groups increase in number as you go across left to right along the table.
     * Subsets:
         1. Alkali Metals - Group 1 Metals (1st column metals)
             * All these elements react with water, to form Alkaline compounds
             * When they form ions, the ions are +1
         2. Alkali Earth Metals - Group 2 Metals (2nd column metals)
             * They form +2 cations when in ionic form
         3. Halogens - 2nd to last group (F, Cl, Br, I)
             * Are all di-atomic (when reacting must have two of the atom i.e. F)
             * They all form -1 anions when in ionic form
         4. Noble Gases - Last group (very last column)
             * Form the most part all the elements are unreactive
             * OFten the alkili metals, alkaline earth metals, and the groups from Boron to Flourine are grouped together and called main elements
         5. Transition Metals - The group in the center of the periodic table sandwiched between the main group elements
         6. Post-Transition Metals - Metals to the right of the Transition Metals
         7. Lanthanides + Actinides - The 2 rows found below the periodic table

There are three different types of elements in the P.T.

1. metal
    * react with water
    * shiny
    * malleable
    * solid at room temp
    * conduct electricity very well
2. non-metal
    * not shiny
    * found in mixtures and compounds
    * Can exist in a variety of states (gas --> solid)
    * don't conduct electricity very well
    * many exist as di-atomic molecule in elemental form
3. metalloid
    * Have properties of both metals, and non-metals
    * Most conduct electricity, many are used as semiconductors
    
####Compounds
Two main types of compounds

1. Ionic compound
    * Two or more ions bonded together, always characterized by a metal and non-metal bonded together
    * Dissolve in water, are crystalline, shatter upon impact, and have high melting points
    * The metal always becomes the cation, the non-metal becomes the anion.
    * i.e. Na<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup> = NaCl the compound is balanced
    * A formula unit must always have a net charge of zeros
